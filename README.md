<br>
As you begin your path on becoming a coding specialist it is always pleasant to find good sources of information. Many computer languages might be tricky to learn at the beginning so you need reliable references to double-check your mistakes and learn how to not make them again. This project has a vast range of programming books which you can read online or download locally.
